## Description

This project aims to develop a predictive model for heart disease using a combination of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. By leveraging two well-known datasets - the UCI Heart Disease dataset and the Heart Disease dataset - the goal is to improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions, aiding in early detection and prevention of heart disease.

## Key Features

1. **Data Collection**: Utilizes two datasets containing relevant features such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and presence of heart disease.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Performs data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering to prepare the datasets for model training.
3. **Model Development**:
    - **Machine Learning Models**: Employs traditional ML algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, Multilayer perceptron, Voting classifier(cv) and support vector machines (SVM) based on the UCI Heart Disease dataset.
    - **Deep Learning Models**: Utilizes neural network architectures including feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and recurrent neural networks (RNN) using the Heart Disease dataset.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the performance of both ML and DL models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).
5. **Model Integration**: Combines the predictions from the ML and DL models to create an ensemble model, improving overall prediction accuracy.
6. **Deployment**: Provides guidelines for deploying the predictive model in real-world scenarios, enabling healthcare professionals to use it for early detection and risk assessment of heart disease.
7. **Documentation and Visualization**: Offers comprehensive documentation of the project, including explanations of data preprocessing steps, model architectures, evaluation results, and visualizations of key insights and performance metrics.
8. **Github Repository**: The project code, along with detailed instructions and documentation, is hosted on a Github repository to facilitate collaboration, transparency, and reproducibility.

By combining the strengths of both ML and DL models and leveraging multiple datasets, this project aims to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of heart disease prediction, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare outcomes and patient well-being.
